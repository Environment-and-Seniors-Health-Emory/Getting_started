# CMS Medicare Data Usage Policy

> Contact Dr. Liuhua Shi | Emory University (liuhua.shi@emory.edu)

#### Here is a friendly reminder of what are the CMS data user responsibilities. Please read the info below and comply with these rules:
#####  ·  Per CMS policy, only study investigators included in the DUA will have access to the data. 
#####  ·  Everyone needs to complete CITI Training (including HIPAA training) before accessing the dataset.
#####  ·  Medicare data must be analyzed/stored on secure level-3 HPC cluster or T-drive, and cannot be downloaded or shared with others. 
#####  ·  Data will never be stored locally on a laptop nor on removable media devices. All output containing individual identifiable information will never be transferred electronically via email or other protocols.  
#####  ·  Individuals not physically located in the US cannot access the data.
#####  ·  HIPAA violations can be felonies, resulting in jail time and a maximum penalty of $1.5 million per year for violations of an identical provision. 
#####  ·  Due to the large size of the dataset, limited storage, and computational capacity/resources at this time, I would suggest starting from a small region (e.g., California). 
#####  ·  Please fill out the data request form (link provided below) for every new project you start with the CMS data, and an approval from Dr. Shi is needed. The dataset(s) shall be used for the proposed project only.
